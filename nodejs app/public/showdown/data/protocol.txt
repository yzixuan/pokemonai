The Showdown protocol.

Changes from old protocol:

- "ally" renamed "p1", "foe" renamed "p2"
- Dashes in commands are no longer used, and abbreviations are used more liberally. It's still human-readable _enough_, and saves a tiny bit of bandwidth.
- "r-" and "residual " were merged into "-"

The main thing is that stuff that previously like:

	stealth-rock-damage foe-Excadrill 3.125
	residual foe-Rotom-W item-heal Leftovers
	r-volatile ally-Seviper leech-seed

will look something like:

	-damage p2-Excadrill 3.125 e:StealthRock
	-heal p2-Rotom-W 6.25 i:Leftovers
	-start p1-Seviper e:LeechSeed

	If [side full] is empty, remove the Side in that slot.

	The same as p1 and p2. Can be ignored by clients that don't support 3-player and 4-player.
